What are data structures, and why are they important?\n","\n","Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently.\n","They’re important because they:\n","\n","Optimize data access and manipulation.\n","\n","Improve code efficiency and performance.\n","\n","Enable developers to choose the right tool for the right problem (e.g., using a set for uniqueness or a dictionary for fast lookups).\n","\n","2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n","\n","Mutable data types can be changed after creation.\n","Example:\n","\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","my_list.append(4)  # modifies the same object\n","\n","\n","Immutable data types cannot be altered after creation.\n","Example:\n","\n","my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","# You cannot add or remove elements from a tuple\n","\n","3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","Feature\tList\tTuple\n","Mutability\tMutable\tImmutable\n","Syntax\t[ ]\t( )\n","Performance\tSlower\tFaster\n","Use case\tWhen data changes\tWhen data should remain constant\n","4. Describe how dictionaries store data.\n","\n","Dictionaries store data as key–value pairs using a hashing mechanism.\n","Each key is hashed to find its index in memory, allowing O(1) average-time lookups.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","student = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 21}\n","# 'name' and 'age' are keys; \"Alice\" and 21 are values\n","\n","5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","\n","Use a set when:\n","\n","You need to store unique items.\n","\n","You want fast membership testing (in checks).\n","\n","Sets automatically remove duplicates and use hashing internally.\n","\n","6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","\n","A string is an immutable sequence of characters.\n","Differences:\n","\n","Strings can only contain text characters; lists can hold any data type.\n","\n","Strings are immutable; lists are mutable.\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","s = \"hello\"\n","# s[0] = 'H' -> ❌ Error\n","\n","7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","\n","Because tuples are immutable, their contents cannot be altered after creation.\n","This ensures that data remains consistent and unmodified throughout the program.\n","\n","8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","\n","A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hashing function.\n","Python dictionaries are implemented as hash tables, enabling constant-time (O(1)) lookups, insertions, and deletions.\n","\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","\n","Yes. Python lists can store mixed data types:\n","\n","mixed = [1, \"two\", 3.0, [4, 5]]\n","\n","10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","\n","Strings are immutable to:\n","\n","Ensure hashing consistency (so they can be used as dictionary keys).\n","\n","Improve performance and security, since their content can’t be changed in memory.\n","\n","11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","\n","Dictionaries offer:\n","\n","Faster lookups using keys instead of index searches.\n","\n","Meaningful key-value relationships, improving readability.\n","\n","Dynamic and unordered data storage.\n","\n","12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","\n","When you want to:\n","\n","Store fixed data (e.g., geographic coordinates (lat, long)).\n","\n","Use as a dictionary key (since tuples are hashable).\n","\n","Protect data from accidental modification.\n","\n","13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","\n","Sets automatically remove duplicates because they only store unique elements:\n","\n","s = {1, 2, 2, 3}\n","print(s)  # {1, 2, 3}\n","\n","14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","\n","For lists, in checks if an element exists (linear search, O(n)).\n","\n","For dictionaries, in checks for the presence of a key (hash lookup, O(1)).\n","\n","15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n","\n","No. Tuples are immutable, so elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n","However, if a tuple contains a mutable object (like a list), that internal object can still change.\n","\n","16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n","\n","A nested dictionary is a dictionary inside another dictionary.\n","Use case: representing structured data (like JSON).\n","\n","Example:\n","\n","students = {\n","  \"Alice\": {\"age\": 21, \"major\": \"CS\"},\n","  \"Bob\": {\"age\": 22, \"major\": \"Math\"}\n","}\n","\n","17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n","\n","Average-case: O(1) (constant time)\n","Worst-case (rare): O(n) due to hash collisions.\n","\n","18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","\n","Use lists when:\n","\n","Data has no meaningful keys.\n","\n","You need ordered data or index-based access.\n","\n","You expect duplicate values.\n","\n","19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","\n","Before Python 3.7, dictionaries did not preserve insertion order.\n","Although modern versions do, conceptually they remain unordered — meaning element order doesn’t affect lookup or behavior.\n","\n","20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","\n","List: Access data by index (e.g., my_list[0]).\n","\n","Dictionary: Access data by key (e.g., my_dict[\"name\"]), which is faster and more descriptive."],"metadata":{"id":"fwdLITINdDbc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
